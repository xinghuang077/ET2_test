## ET2_test chip test
  - ET2_test chip test document, python code and firmware code.

  - ET2 has four circutry blocks including dedicated Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC), Electrical Fuse (E-Fuse), and Temperature Sensor (TS). These blocks will be used in the coming ETROC2 chip. They should be fully tested and give the confidence to reuse or entend in ETROC2 chip.

## File organization
  - The repository is used to store the test document and the test code for recording and sharing. The code includes the python code communicated with I2C and the firmware for the TDC test.
